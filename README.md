## About

I was asked to build a webpage for planning trips that would allow users to search for a city name and see the current weather conditions along with a five-day forecast. The page utilizes the OpenWeather One Call API to select the correct city and request weather data. In addition to displaying the weather, the page saves each search term in local storage to let the user quickly retrieve data for cities they've recently searched. The page is also responsive for mobile devices.
